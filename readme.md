this is image stegonograpy tool
aka stego
to use select your image and zip and drag them to the exe when it says open with stego realease and stego will hide the zip in the image the result image is named new-image
you can use bmp gif ico jpg png tif
but you have to use the correct stego version for each image file
eg bmp = stego-bmp.exe
you need windows for now
i may work on stego or different operatin systems
feel free to decompile stego for the source code
stego is written in python 3
